Hi, I'm Ian! I am currently a <a href = "https://allenai.org/predoctoral-young-investigators">predoctoral researcher</a> on the <a href = "https://allenai.org/allennlp">AllenNLP</a> team at <a href = "https://allenai.org">Allen Institute for AI (AI2)</a>. My research interests include advancing reproducibility and evaluation in NLP as well as improving the understanding of textual domains to make robust and efficient language models.

Previously, I got my MS in computer science from Northeastern University, and interned at <a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/">AWS</a> AI Labs and <a href = "https://www.sift.net">SIFT</a>. I also hold a BA in cultural anthropology from Bard College.
